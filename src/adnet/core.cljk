(ns adnet.core
  "First-party ad network / ad-server core — pure Clojure/ClojureScript.

  The ad-serving brain of our OWN ad network (an alternative to depending on a
  third-party network like ExoClick and its fill rate), the advertising twin of
  the x402 payment stack: advertisers bid in USDC (settled through the x402
  rail, see adnet.billing), publishers (shinshi / isekai / kotobase / …) run
  this auction at each placement to pick the winning creative, and a first-party
  house ad backfills when no paid campaign qualifies. cloud-itonami operates the
  advertiser-facing campaign management (its ops-LLM ⊣ CertGovernor propose →
  govern → commit loop); this library is the pure selection + pacing logic both
  the publisher ad-server and the advertiser control plane share.

  Same invariants as the rest of kotoba-lang's monetization stack (pay/treasury):
  pure .cljc, zero network I/O, zero deps. The host injects storage, the clock,
  and USDC settlement; this namespace only decides which ad wins and what it
  costs.

  Money is USDC micros (integer, 6 decimals) on the wire, matching pay.core.")
